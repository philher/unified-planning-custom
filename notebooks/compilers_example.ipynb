    "The quantifiers remover compiles away all the quantifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by taking every expression in the problem and grounding the quantifiers (Exists and Forall) with the equivalent formula in the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in our problem, the goal `Forall(job_done(j_var), j_var)` is equivalent to `job_done(clean) and job_done(work)`, because we only have 2 possible values that the `j_var` variable can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension of expressions created\n",
    "\n",
    "For every quantifier, a \"big\" `Or` or `And` will be created. The length of the final expression replacing the quantifier depends on the number of variables of the quantifier itself and the number of objects of each variable type (considering the typing hierarchy).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the exact length, we must multiply for every variable the number of objects of the variable type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in our problem we have quantifiers with only 1 variable, so we get a length of 2 (because we have 2 objects of type `Heater` and 2 objects of type `Job`)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had 3 types `A`, `B` and `C`, and 3 objects of type `A`, 2 objects of type `B` and 5 objects of type `C`, with a quantifier with 3 varibales of type `A`, `B` and `C` we would get an expression of length 30. If we have a quantifier with 5 variables, 2 of type `A` and 3 of type `C`, we would get a length of `3^2 * 5^3 = 6 * 125 = 750`; so we see that the length of the expression created increases linearly with the number of objects of the variable type and exponentially with the number of variables in the quantifier."
